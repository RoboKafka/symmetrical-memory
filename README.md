# Face Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a C++ program that performs real-time face detection using OpenCV and the Haar cascade classifier. It captures video from the default camera and draws bounding boxes around detected faces.

## Prerequisites

- OpenCV 4.x: Make sure you have OpenCV installed on your system. You can download it from the official OpenCV website or install it using package managers like apt or homebrew.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RoboKafka/symmetrical-memory.git
